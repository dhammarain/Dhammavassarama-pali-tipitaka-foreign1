<H3>Translator's Introduction</H3>This discourse is an interesting example of 
the folklore of the Pali Canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular 
Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, 
has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates 
that the long "tribute" section of this discourse is very old, while the verses 
in the introductory section -- which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya -- are 
later in form. This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was 
an earlier composition -- in the honorific style of the ancient court bards -- 
to which the introduction was added later. This judgment is based on the fact 
that the two sections do not quite fit each other. The introduction to the 
tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself, whereas 
the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise. 
<P>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali Canon to a 
"who's who" of the deva worlds, and should provide useful material for anyone 
interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism. 
<P>The Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy hearing this discourse 
chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks' standard memorized 
repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even 
today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by 
the wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse 
regularly. 
<HR>

<P>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the <A 
name=sakyan>Sakyans</A> at <A name=kapilavatthu>Kapilavatthu</A> in the Great 
Wood, together with a large Sangha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus, all 
of them arahants. And most of the devatas from ten world-systems had gathered in 
order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Then the thought occurred 
to four devatas of the ranks from the Pure Abodes: "The Blessed One is dwelling 
among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large 
Sangha of about five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the 
devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One and 
the Bhikkhu Sangha. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us 
each speak a verse in his presence." 
<P>Then, <A name=strongman>just as</A> a strong man might extend his flexed arm 
or flex his extended arm, those devatas disappeared from among the devas of the 
Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the 
Blessed One, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devata 
recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>A great meeting in the woods:<BR>The deva hosts have 
  assembled.<BR>We have come to this Dhamma meeting<BR>To see the invincible 
  Sangha. </BLOCKQUOTE>Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's 
presence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bhikkhus there are concentrated,<BR>Have straightened their 
  own minds.<BR>Like a charioteer holding the reins,<BR>The wise ones guard 
  their faculties. </BLOCKQUOTE>Then another devata recited this verse in the 
Blessed One's presence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,<BR>Having 
  uprooted <A name=indra>Indra</A>'s pillar, unstirred,<BR>They wander about 
  pure, unstained,<BR>Young nagas well tamed by the One with Vision. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's 
presence: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge<BR>Will not go to the 
  plane of woe.<BR>On discarding the human body,<BR>They will fill the hosts of 
  the devas. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, most of the devatas from 
ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and the Bhikkhu 
Sangha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, at most 
had their devata-gathering like mine at the present. Those who, in the future, 
will be Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their 
devata-gathering like mine at the present. I will detail for you the names of 
the deva hosts. I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts. I will teach 
you the names of the deva hosts. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak." 
<P>"As you say, lord," the monks replied. The Blessed One said: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>I recite a verse of tribute.<BR>Those who live where spirits 
  dwell,<BR>who live in mountain caves,<BR>resolute, concentrated,<BR>many, like 
  hidden lions,<BR>who have overcome horripilation,<BR>white-hearted, 
  pure,<BR>serene, and undisturbed:<BR>Knowing that more than 500 of them<BR>had 
  come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,<BR>the Teacher then said to 
  them,<BR>disciples delighting in his instruction,<BR>"The deva hosts have 
  approached.<BR>Detect them, monks!"<BR>Listening to the Awakened One's 
  instruction,<BR>they made a diligent effort.<BR>Knowledge appeared to 
  them,<BR>vision of non-human beings.<BR>Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 
  70,000,<BR>some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.<BR>Some gained vision 
  of innumerable devas<BR>filling every direction.<BR>Realizing all this,<BR>the 
  One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.<BR>The Teacher then said to 
  them,<BR>disciples delighting in his instruction,<BR>"The deva hosts have 
  approached.<BR>Detect them, monks,<BR>as I describe their glories, one by one.
